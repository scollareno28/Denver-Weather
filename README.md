# ⛅ Denver Weather Data Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical weather data in Denver, Colorado, using various data science techniques.  
The goal is to uncover insights about weather patterns, temperature trends, and seasonal variations over time.

The project uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and simple modeling to better understand weather behaviors in the region.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Weather dataset loaded from a CSV file.
   - Focused on variables like temperature (high, low, average), precipitation, snowfall, and wind speed.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted date columns to `datetime` types.
   - Handled missing values appropriately (e.g., filling or removing as needed).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Studied trends in temperature, precipitation, and snowfall.
   - Visualized daily, monthly, and yearly patterns using line plots, histograms, and boxplots.
   - Identified seasonal trends and anomalies.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created detailed plots:
     - Average temperature trends by month.
     - Distribution of daily precipitation and snowfall.
     - Boxplots of temperatures by season.
     - Rolling averages for temperature smoothing.

5. **Key Insights**
   - Noted that Denver exhibits wide seasonal variations in temperature and snowfall.
   - Precipitation is typically low but with sharp spikes during certain months.
   - Snowfall is highly seasonal and concentrated in winter and early spring.

## 📊 Key Results

- **Temperature Extremes:** Summer months (July–August) are hottest; January is coldest.
- **Snowfall Patterns:** Snowfall peaks in March and late fall (November-December).
- **Precipitation:** Rain is sporadic but highest in late spring and early summer.
- **Wind Speed:** No extreme patterns; relatively steady year-round.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Incorporate **more recent weather data** to analyze climate change impacts.
- Build **predictive models** for future weather forecasts (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet models).
- Conduct **comparative studies** between Denver and other major U.S. cities.
- Add **extreme weather event** detection (e.g., blizzards, droughts).
